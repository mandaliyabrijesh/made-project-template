## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
**Analysis of Crime Trends in the USA: A State-by-State Study of Estimated Crimes**

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How have crime rates evolved across different states from 1979 to 2019?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project, **"Analysis of Crime Trends in the USA: A State-by-State Study of Estimated Crimes"** aims to investigate how crime patterns have evolved across the United States over the past several decades. The analysis uses two complementary datasets: one with FBI crime estimates covering every U.S. state from 1979 to 2019, offering a long-term perspective on national and state-level crime trends, and another with detailed crime records from the City of Chicago, updated daily and sourced directly from local police data.

The project’s core goals are to create an efficient pipeline for data collection, clean and prepare the data for analysis, and examine both national and local crime patterns. By identifying trends in specific types of crimes and highlighting states with rising or declining rates, the analysis seeks to uncover underlying shifts in crime over time. Visualization will play a key role in presenting these findings, showing which states and areas may need more attention in crime prevention efforts. Given recent events and rising public awareness around crime in the U.S., this project aims to provide data-driven insights that can inform discussions on public safety and policy.
